Word spreads fast and far on the Internet, and to motivate our community for active participation, we have decided to gamify the social activities of our user base and attribute points. We call this mechanism Proof of Charity.\nProof of Charity is the most important part of the whole CHERR.IO platform, because it serves as a basis for all other mechanisms built on top of it. As such, it is the driving force behind the community, and a feature that fundamentally challenges the current operational structure of charitable organizations. It is a new way of reaching out to society and asking for help, i.e. a way of leveraging the power of community to expand\nitself. It makes advertising and the resulting heavy costs obsolete because it tasks the community with that job. Since advertising costs have a severe impact on the budgets of charities, using the CHERR.IO platform to drastically reduce these costs can result in more funds going to the people who need them the most."
